# Loan-Prediction
Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.

To address this challenge, I introduce a machine-learning model predicting the loan eligibility of applicants based on the information provided during the loan application process.
